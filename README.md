Learning how to use Git and Github. If you have any other resources to add, feel free to put it in. This list will continue to grow and be better structured once I get a better sense of using Github.

Putting down links of supposedly helpful resource to check out in the future:
For Github:
https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/ - which is what I'm basing this practice on.
